                    <p>Thank you to all of you who supported my re-election. I am grateful to each and every one of you for helping contribute to another victorious win! Four years ago, you helped create a moment in history. I was honored to be elected to serve on the MWDOC board as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The youngest director ever</li>
                            <li>The first woman of color</li>
                            <li>The first female engineer</li>
                            <li>The second Asian-American</li>
                            <li>The third female director MWDOC's nearly 70-year history</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>Since 1951, the board has had a lot of directors, and to be frankly honest, I didn’t realize how much of an impact I was making simply by being these firsts, seconds, and thirds. I never turn down an opportunity to speak to the next generation, and I had given many presentations prior, but it really clicked when I spoke at Career Day for Breakthrough San Juan Capistrano.This program is committed to breaking the cycle of poverty through the power of education by supporting first-gen students from middle school through college graduation. </p><p>These kids weren’t that impressed with the fact that I was a female engineer or a business owner. The thing that resonated with them most was the fact that I was elected to represent their community as a woman of color – someone that looked different and understood firsthand what it meant to be part of an underrepresented group. Diverse perspectives and insights help foster greater innovation and better solutions long-term.</p>
 
                    <p>I’m honored to be re-elected to serve, and I thank you for your vote of confidence.</p>
